# 👋 Hi, I'm Rakesh Basani  
### Azure Cloud & DevOps Engineer | Terraform | Azure DevOps | Linux | CI/CD | Automation

I'm a Cloud Engineer based in the UK with 12+ years of experience supporting and operating large‑scale cloud and on‑premise applications across Azure, AWS, Linux/UNIX, and Windows environments.  
I specialise in building reliable, automated, and scalable cloud platforms using Azure, Terraform, Docker, and CI/CD pipelines.

This GitHub showcases my journey from Cloud/Application Support to full Azure Cloud Engineering — with hands‑on projects in infrastructure, automation, monitoring, and DevOps.
